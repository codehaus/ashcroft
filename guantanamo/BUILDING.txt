There are two ways to build Guantanamo:

1) FULL BUILD
Put your clover 1.1.1 in your $ANT_HOME/lib folder (I haven't tested with any newer versions)
Then just run ant (the default target)

This will run the entire acceptance test suite and self-validation, i.e. running Guantanamo over itself
and verifying that no code was deleted. (The test suite uses a nifty ASTTestCase to compare the
original and guantanamoed sources - it's similar to XMLUnit, but works with Java Source code).

At the end of the build you should get a target/guantanamo.jar file.

2) SIMPLE BUILD
Just run ant simple-build. This will create a target/guantanamo.jar file.
