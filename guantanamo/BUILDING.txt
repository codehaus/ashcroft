There are two ways to build Guantanamo:

1) DOGFOOD
This will build Guantanamo, run the full test suite and run itself over its own source code. The final step is to verify that no
source code was deleted - i.e. 100% test coverage.

1.1) Put your clover 1.1.1 or higher in your $ANT_HOME/lib folder (I haven't tested with any newer versions)
1.2) Put JCoverage and all its dependencies in the ./lib folder
1.3) ant dogfood

2) JAR
This will build the target/dist/guantanamo.jar file. None of the test coverage tool jars need to be present.

1.1) ant jar
